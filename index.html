    <h1>Hewooo, My Love, my dear Frea, my lovely Anya üå∏‚ú®</h1>
    <h2>Happy 22nd Birthday üí´</h2>

    <p>Twenty-two. What a number. Twenty-two years of your laughter, your tears, your quiet battles, your loud victories, your dreams whispering themselves into being. Twenty-two years of becoming <em>you.</em></p>

    <p>And here I am, lucky enough to know this version of you ‚Äî the one who carries a thousand shades of strength and softness, the one who both steadies me and sets me free.</p>

    <p>I want to say this honestly: I‚Äôm sorry. Sorry for the times I let my storms spill into your sunshine, sorry for the moments where I become heavy in your hands. I feel bad for every moment I make it harder for you to just breathe and be. And yet‚Ä¶ you stay. You hold me in ways that teach me what love really is.</p>

    <p>Thank you for being light when I feel heavy, for being steady when I feel scattered. Thank you for loving me not just when I shine, but also when I crumble. Thank you for being the person you‚Äôve been, the soul you are now, and the becoming you‚Äôre still walking toward.</p>

    <p>So here‚Äôs to you, my 22-year-old wonder. ü©µ May this year be soft to you. May it bring you joy so deep it makes your heart overflow, and peace so steady it feels like home. May the universe lean gently in your favor, weaving blessings into your every step. And may you never forget, not for a single moment, how deeply, endlessly, unapologetically loved you are.</p>

    <p class="signature">Always and forever yours,<br>Kiel ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
